### Introduction
This talk is by Dr. Michael Stonebraker.

This Turing Award talk intermixes a bicycle ride across America during the summer of 1988 with the design, construction and commercialization of Postgres during the late 80's and early 90's.  Striking parallels are observed, leading to a discussion of what it takes to build a new DBMS.  Also, indicated are the roles that perseverance and serendipity played in both endeavors.

### Thoughts
That's is the first time I saw the Turing Award owner. This is amazing because the person who has the award is not as different as I imaged before.

He talks about the experience in his bike travel across America compared with the path the Postgresql being proposed. Both are difficult but exciting. Every experience has its track with both Highs and lows. So the truth of success is to shine during highs and persist during lows.
